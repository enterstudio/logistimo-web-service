        <p>
            Replenishment response time report provides an understanding of the average amount of time taken to
            replenish stock from either a zero stock level to a non-zero stock level, or a < min level to a normal
            (in-range) or >= max stock level, or a change from a > max stock level (to either normal, < min or even zero
            stock).
        </p>

        <p>
            The metrics in this report as described below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Replenish from zero stock:</b> This metric represents the time taken for a stock
                level of an inventory item to go from zero stock level to a non-zero stock level, which could be either
                normal stock level, < min or > max stock levels. At aggregate levels, the average time across closed
                zero stock events is computed. The replenishment duration is attributed to the period in which the zero
                stock item was replenished (or the event was closed).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Replenish from < min:</b> This metric represents the (average) time taken
                for a stock level of an inventory item to go from < min stock level to either a normal (in-range) stock
                level or > max levels. At aggregate levels, the average time across closed < min stock events is
                computed. The replenishment duration is attributed to the period in which the < min stock item was
                replenished (or the event was closed).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Change from > max:</b> This metric represents the (average) time taken for
                a stock level of an inventory item to go from a > max stock level to either a = max, normal (in-range),
                < min or zero stock level. At aggregate levels, the average time across closed > max stock events is
                computed. The change duration is attributed to the period in which the > max stock item changed to go
                below the max level (or the event was closed).
