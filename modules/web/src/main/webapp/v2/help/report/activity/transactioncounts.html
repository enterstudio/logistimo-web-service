        <p>
            Transaction counts report provides an overview of transaction activity across entities. The basic metric is
            a count on the number of transactions across all types or a particular type of transaction, such as issue,
            receipt, stock count, discard or transfer.
        </p>

        <p>
            The metrics in this report as described below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Number of transactions:</b> This metric represents the number of transactions - either all or of a particular type - done in the given period.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Average number of transactions per entity:</b> This metric is computed by dividing the total number of transactions by the number of entities to obtain an average transaction count per entity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>% entities with transactions:</b> This metric represents the proportion of entities which have at least one transaction in the given period. This is computed by dividing the number of entities with at least one transaction in the given period by the total number of entities in that period.
            </li>
        </ul>
